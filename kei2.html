Kendu Elements Initiative 2 (KEI-2): Focused advocacy campaigns for projects under the Kendu umbrella
Background
One factor currently limiting the community’s effectiveness in increasing awareness of the KENDU token is the relatively narrow avenues in which it is possible to discuss cryptocurrencies. Outside of our IRL efforts, there are only a handful of online spaces that we routinely tap into, including but not limited to a specific set of subreddits, replies to crypto-related posts on X, certain leaderboards such as Capitoday, and other platforms such as Stocktwits and CMC." />

  <br>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>One factor currently limiting the community’s effectiveness in increasing awareness of the KENDU token is the relatively narrow avenues in which it is possible to discuss cryptocurrencies. Outside of our IRL efforts, there are only a handful of online spaces that we routinely tap into, including but not limited to a specific set of subreddits, replies to crypto-related posts on X, certain leaderboards such as Capitoday, and other platforms such as Stocktwits and CMC.</p>
<p>As we have a thriving ecosystem of projects operating under the Kendu umbrella, there is currently a large, mostly untapped opportunity to increase awareness of Kendu, and by extension the KENDU token, in digital spaces that do not normally allow cryptocurrency discussion.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>
<p>This is a recurring proposal in which Elements holders can vote for a <em>Kendu Project of the Month</em>, with the highest voted project receiving concrete, strong advocacy by the community through a range of different means (expanded below). By mainly focusing on a single project in the ecosystem each month, it allows us to discuss and then mount effective campaigns that benefit from strength in numbers.</p>
<p>Individual projects can opt out of this program if they do not wish to participate, for instance due to their product offering not yet being ready.</p>
<p>Once a project comes out on top for a month, it cannot be renominated for at least one year or until all other eligible projects have been cycled through, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>This proposal fulfils the key Elements criteria of being beneficial to the KENDU token as bolstering awareness of projects in the ecosystem leads to greater interest in the token, even if the latter is not mentioned at all during the advocacy process. <strong>This also does not interfere with our normal token advocacy as there are, to reiterate from the <em>Background</em> section, far more avenues to recommend a product or service than there are to discuss a cryptocurrency.</strong></p>
<p>In comparison to KEI-1, this proposal is somewhat more in tune with the original vision for Elements outlined in September, in that it directly addresses the coordination problem for long, complex campaigns. Nevertheless, KEI-2 remains compatible with KEI-1, as the latter is a longer-term initiative that becomes more relevant when the ecosystem reaches a higher level of overall profitability. For this reason, the community might elect for the vote for KEI-1 to not be held until a little later down the track.</p>
<p>As an example to illustrate the proposal, let’s assume that Kendu Energy comes out on top for a given round. We can then typically expect the following to take place during <em>Kendu Energy Month</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, an ongoing discussion, both on the Elements Discourse forum and the Kendu TG, on ideas around specific communities to focus on.</li>
<li>If you have personally tried Kendu Energy, or have heard good things about it from other members in the community, it is recommended to share this in online and in-person settings relevant to the product.</li>
<li>Online events such as Reddit AMAs and X Spaces hosted the project owner, which not only gives our own community a genuine opportunity to ask questions about the product and how it came about, but a chance for curious outsiders to join in as well.</li>
<li>Detailed Reddit posts, X threads and other social media posts by our community.</li>
<li>Rapid development of technical aspects missing from the project, such as a simple landing page or branding work (I can personally help with both of these).</li>
<li>Given that we are geographically dispersed, we can create and stick product stickers in public spaces and noticeboards.</li>
<li>Other strategies floated by the community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like other Elements proposals, discussion is highly encouraged in the lead up to voting.</p>
