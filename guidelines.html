  <h1 id="kendu-elements-guidelines-and-proposal-recommendations-draft">Kendu Elements guidelines and proposal recommendations [draft]</h1>
  
<p><i>The most important thing to keep in mind is that these guidelines are preliminary and will undergo a process of rigorous community feedback before finalisation. Kendu Elements is a community-run project and this extends not only to the initiatives born out of it but the governance procedures themselves.</i></p>
<br>
<h2 id="1-proposals-must-aim-to-bolster-kendus-market-cap">1. Proposals must aim to bolster Kendu’s market cap</h2>
<p>All main track proposals must be geared towards improving Kendu’s market cap. There is some flexibility in terms of the degree of directness of this aspect, as sometimes slightly less direct initiatives can still have a positive impact on our market cap, but at the same time we do not want it to be flexible to the point where we end up focusing on low-impact initiatives. Because the line in the sand will depend on context, Elements takes the approach of leaving borderline cases to the community through the proposal voting process.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="2-focus-on-medium-to-longer-term-initiatives">2. Focus on medium-to-longer-term initiatives</h2>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, avoid floating proposals that only consist of a small set of actions over a very short timeframe or a single activity that could be easily coordinated on Telegram, as this will only create redundancy with our existing channels and not take advantage of the strengths of this Snapshot space. Rather, the emphasis should be on medium-to-longer-term initiatives where a decent amount of coordination is necessary.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="3-proposals-must-not-relate-to-the-fundamental-direction-of-kendu-itself">3. Proposals must not relate to the fundamental direction of Kendu itself</h2>
<p>As stated in the Elements introductory post, proposals must not seek to make foundational changes to Kendu itself (e.g., changing the focus of Kendu away from a brandcoin etc). This is outside of the scope of the project.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="4-implementation-of-proposals-is-non-binding">4. Implementation of proposals is non-binding</h2>
<p>Consistent with the Elements introductory post, proposals are non-binding and the degree to which they are taken up will depend on the community. The primary purpose of Elements is to solve problems around coordination and longer-term planning, not to impose strict adherence. This also disincentivises bad actors from acquiring governance tokens solely for the purpose of floating malicious proposals that can potentially slip through the other safeguards, essentially acting as a final line of defence.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="5-proposal-lifecycle">5. Proposal lifecycle</h2>
<p>It is strongly advised to first temp check the general idea behind a proposal in the main Kendu discussion channels (Telegram, Reddit, and soon, the Elements Discourse forum) before fleshing out a detailed version. This is because it is advantageous to get a broad sense of the likelihood a proposal will pass prior to spending a good amount of time working on it. Once a formal proposal is published, it will undergo a period of voting and if the quorum is reached and it clears a simple majority, the outcome will be subsequently broadcast on the main Elements communication channels.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="6-recommended-proposal-structure">6. Recommended proposal structure</h2>
<p>Although not required, it is recommended to break up proposals into at least two parts, consisting of a <em>background</em> section and the main <em>proposal</em> section. The <em>background</em> section should be used to provide the rationale for the proposal and a brief explanation of how the initiative will likely improve Kendu’s market cap. Meanwhile, the main <em>proposal</em> section should go into the details of the initiative itself, providing examples of certain aspects where relevant, while keeping the length manageable and easy to follow as possible. For a simple example of a proposal that reflects this structure, see <a href="https://kenduelements.xyz/kei2">KEI-2</a>.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="7-proposal-moderation">7. Proposal moderation</h2>
<p>The philosophy of Elements is that there is a lot of leeway for proposals and that the community should ultimately be the arbiter of success for any given initiative. For instance, if a proposal is written poorly to the point where it is difficult to follow, in all likelihood it will simply not receive the necessary votes to pass.</p>
<p>Proposals will only be taken down in <em>severe</em> breaches of the rules, such as clearly malicious proposals or unambiguous spam. When this occurs, it will be done transparently and announced to the community, with the reason for the removal stated publicly.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="8-onchain-based-initiatives">8. Onchain-based initiatives</h2>
<p>Any initiatives born out of Elements that are completely onchain (i.e., able to run solely smart contracts) can <em>optionally</em> have a component where some of the revenue is automatically distributed to all Elements holders (enforced programmatically through the blockchain), but as the focus of Elements must remain on growing Kendu itself, a minimum of 70% of such revenue must go to either the official Kendu treasury address or used to buyback and burn the Kendu token.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="9-sponsorship-slot-and-elements-independence">9. Sponsorship slot and Elements’ independence</h2>
<p>The rotating sponsorship slot has no bearing on the independence of Elements. In concrete terms, this means that Elements will not carry out actions, e.g., additional promotion of a proposal on Elements social media channels, when such a proposal happens to mention the ecosystem project currently occupying the slot. Elements is community-driven and these proposals will go through the usual voting process just like any other.</p>
